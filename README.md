# 🍋 MangoFruitDDS: Statistics, Analysis, and Prediction

This project focuses on exploring and predicting mango fruit defect detection system (DDS) outcomes using machine learning models. A comprehensive analysis was performed on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, with model comparison based on multiple evaluation metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

- *Source:* [MangoFruitDDS Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/mangofruitdds)
- The dataset contains features related to mango fruit attributes and defect classifications.

## 🧠 Models Used

The following classification models were applied and compared:

- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

- AUC-ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Confusion Matrix
- Box Plots

## 🏆 Results
